# numpy
This is my learning notes and codes from the NumPy Data Science Essential Training class from LinkedIn Learning (https://www.linkedin.com/learning/numpy-data-science-essential-training)

The course uses Jupyter notebook. I did my pratice on Jupyter notebook as well. There are a lot of resources on how to use jupyter notebooks. I suggest you have some experience with jupyter notebook or watch basic videos. If you use other IDEs such as Pycharm, it works as well. 

All notes and codes are posted after I finish the course and understand the concepts. The materials I post will be my personal notes from the class. This means that my notes will be different from the materials provided on LinkedIn Learning by the professor to protect his work and to do extra practice by myself.
